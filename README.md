# CV-Website
This site was part of my maturita exam project as student of Information and Network Technologies at the secondary vocational school in Handov√°
## About project in general 
The project focused on the installation and configuration of a Linux server for hosting a website. A ZimaBoard, a compact computer, was used to enable efficient deployment of web applications. The project included the deployment of Apache2, remote access via SSH, securing the server using the UFW firewall, and the use of PHPMailer for sending encrypted emails.
## Goal of project
The goal of the project was to set up a web server on Linux machine and create a simple website. This project focused on a physical server, which allowed for a deeper understanding of hardware and network management. Compared to regular web hosting, this project provided greater control over configuration and security.
